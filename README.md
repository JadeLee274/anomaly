# About this repository:

This repository is for time sereis anomaly detection (TSAD) study; mainly about studying papers, codes, and running experiments by myself. Some of the codes are modified by myself for flexible experiment. Summaries for each directories are liseted below.

## benchmarks
About the generation of synthetic dataset and choice on the data for more deep research on TSAD.

## metrics
About the suggested criticism on current F1-based (with point adjustment) performance and more robust metrics for TSAD task.

## models
About the models that accomplished the state-of-the-art performance for time series anomaly detection.

## rca
About the root cause analysis on TSAD. Aims to find out where the anomaly happened.
